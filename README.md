# WOTSonTWITCH
This is a simple project to view live streamers on TWITCH.TV

A Python script that uses Twitch.tv API to check if a user's followed channels are live.

Installation:
Clone the repository https://github.com/chiragbali1910/WOTSonTWITCH.git or download the zip file.

Dependencies
The script uses the 'requests' package in Python:
pip install requests or python -m pip install requests

Usage
The first time you run the script, it will prompt for your OAuth. You want the string after "oauth:".
This is stored in "oauth.txt", in the same path as you run your script.
Use twitch.tv to get your token ID.
